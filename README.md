##1) Taking the relation “_synset_domain_usage_of” in WN18 as an example, there are total 597 head entities linked by it. The distance distribution among them in initial embedding space and position space is reported in the following table. 

 Distance | >0.6 | >0.8 | >1
 --------|--------|-------- | -------- 
 Initial Embedding Space| 99.9% | 99.5% | 95% 
 Position space| 39.6% | 19% | %7.5
